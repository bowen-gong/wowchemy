- Identified critical features governing the leaching behavior of nuclear materials with supervised learning
- Employed linear regression and KRR to build predictive models and anticipate material performance
- Predicted the leaching rates of nuclear waste materials with machine learning models to screen the most durable candidates for nuclear wastes’ safe disposal
