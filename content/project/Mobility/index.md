- Developed a data-driven epidemiological model to assess the impact of human mobility on the spread of COVID-19
- Calibrated the epidemic model with census and mobility data involving subway
transit
- Estimated the governing epidemic parameters that enable predictions of spread under different diffusion prevention strategies
- Evaluated the impact of various policies, such as the mask mandates and lockdown
to the pandemic spread
- Predicted accurately the daily cases in NYC with the developed model and the mobility data
